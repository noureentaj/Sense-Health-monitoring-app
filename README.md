# Sense-Health-monitoring-app
Sense is an Android application that was the author's final year project. This IoT-based project was made for dementia patients who frequently forget their way back home or just roam away too far. Through this app, the guardian can potentially create a geofence, restricting the patient's whereabouts, which also notifies the guardian if the geofence was trespassed. This app also collects patient's health parameters from the linked real-time database in Firebase, for the guardian to keep track of them. The backend is a Raspberry Pi setup, which is also programmed to schedule an appointment on Google Calendar.
